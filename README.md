# DS-Program-2

This was my submission for my Data Structures Program 2. I was tasked to create a program that solves the SET Daily Puzzle.  
I have included the instructions I was given in Fall20Prog02.pdf.  
I also realize that this program is an absolute monster, but at the time, I couldn't figure out a more efficient way to code it.
